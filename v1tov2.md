# v1 to v2

The breaking changes between v1 to v2 were as follows

- Removed support for non-supported node & npm versions
- Removed support for ESLint 4 and below

These versions are no longer supported by their authors, and this being a security module, it means that in all good conscience: I shouldn't be supporting them either.

That being said, if you find upgrading to newer versions to be unsurmountable, please open an issue. I've been there and I know that feeling, and I'd like to help if I can.
